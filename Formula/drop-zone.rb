# Homebrew formula for the drop-zone client.
#
# Builds only the client. The rendezvous server is an operator's daemon, not
# something a `brew install` should place on a laptop; passing -DDZ_BUILD_SERVER=OFF
# is what keeps it out of the bottle.
#
# The bottle is compiled without -march=native. Every CPU-specific fast path
# (AES-NI vs ChaCha20) is selected at run time — see common/src/cpu.cpp — so a
# bottle built on a machine with VAES still runs on one without, and still takes
# the AES path where the hardware has it.
#
# This file is the copy kept next to the source. The installable tap lives at
# https://github.com/DTYoda/homebrew-tap (brew tap DTYoda/tap). After tagging
# a release, run packaging/homebrew/fill-stable.sh and paste url/sha256 here,
# then copy this file to Formula/drop-zone.rb in that tap.
